echo "Summary of Issues:"
echo "=================="
echo "1. ❌ NPM install explicitly disables progress (--progress=false)"
echo "2. ❌ All Homebrew operations hidden in log file"
echo "3. ❌ Model downloads happen silently in background"
echo "4. ❌ Git progress has gaps between phases"
echo "5. ❌ No timeouts on any operations"
echo "6. ❌ No network connectivity check before starting"
echo "7. ❌ No disk space validation"
echo "8. ❌ Silent failures with || true patterns"
echo ""
echo "Impact: Users will likely abort installation thinking it's frozen"
