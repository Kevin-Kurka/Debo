# Truth-Finding System Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive truth-finding agent system for Debo that uses three specialized agents working together to verify claims, evaluate arguments, and assess source credibility using legal evidence standards.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Core Truth-Finding Components

#### `/src/agents/truth-finding-roles.js` (NEW)
- Defines the three truth-finding agents with detailed prompts:
  - `truth_seeker`: Primary source verification specialist
  - `trial_by_fire`: Adversarial argument analyst
  - `credibility_agent`: Source reliability assessor
- Each agent has specific deliverables and database patterns
- Implements strict legal standards for evidence evaluation

#### `/src/core/evidence-standards.js` (NEW)
- Implements Federal Rules of Evidence standards
- Provides methods for:
  - Evidence admissibility evaluation
  - Hearsay checking with exceptions
  - Authentication verification
  - Best evidence rule compliance
  - Expert testimony validation (Daubert standards)
- Defines burden of proof levels (preponderance, clear and convincing, beyond reasonable doubt)

#### `/src/core/truth-finding-orchestrator.js` (NEW)
- Coordinates the three truth-finding agents
- Manages investigation pipelines with proper dependencies
- Processes and synthesizes results from all agents
- Calculates final verdicts with weighted scoring
- Stores all results in Redis for persistence
- Supports specialized investigation types (political, scientific, legal)

### 2. Integration with Existing System

#### `/src/agents/roles.js` (MODIFIED)
- Added the three truth-finding agents to the main agent configuration
- Integrated with existing Fortune 500 agent structure
- All truth-finding agents use 'thinking' LLM type for complex analysis

#### `/src/core/unified-orchestrator.js` (MODIFIED)
- Imported and initialized TruthFindingOrchestrator
- Added public methods for truth investigations:
  - `investigateClaim()`
  - `getInvestigationResults()`
  - `getAllInvestigations()`
  - Specialized methods for political, scientific, and legal investigations
- Updated task completion handler to route truth-finding agent results

#### `/src/mcp_server_v2.js` (MODIFIED)
- Added `truth_investigate` tool to MCP interface
- Implemented `processTruthInvestigation()` method
- Added comprehensive result formatting
- Integrated with existing orchestrator system

### 3. Documentation and Testing

#### `/docs/TRUTH_FINDING_SYSTEM.md` (NEW)
- Comprehensive documentation of the truth-finding system
- Architecture explanation
- Usage examples
- Best practices and limitations

#### `/test-truth-finding.js` (NEW)
- Test script for verifying the truth-finding functionality
- Includes example test cases for different investigation types
- Shows how to use the orchestrator directly

#### `/package.json` (MODIFIED)
- Added `test:truth` script to run truth-finding tests
- Added `start:v2` and `dev:v2` scripts for the v2 MCP server

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Legal Evidence Standards
- Federal Rules of Evidence compliance
- Hearsay rule implementation with recognized exceptions
- Authentication requirements
- Best evidence rule (originals preferred)
- Expert testimony validation using Daubert factors

### 2. Three-Agent System
- **Truth Seeker**: Only accepts primary sources, rejects hearsay
- **Trial by Fire**: Argues both sides like a court attorney
- **Credibility Agent**: Scores sources 1-100, detects hypocrisies

### 3. Scoring System
- Each agent provides scores (0-100)
- Weighted final verdict calculation:
  - Truth verification: 40%
  - Argument strength: 30%
  - Source credibility: 30%
- Multiple confidence levels based on evidence standards

### 4. Redis State Management
- All investigation data persisted in Redis
- Structured keys for different investigation phases
- Investigation log for historical tracking
- Full results stored for later retrieval

### 5. MCP Tool Interface
The system is accessible via MCP with the `truth_investigate` tool:
```json
{
  "claim": "The claim to investigate",
  "type": "general|political|scientific|legal",
  "sources": ["optional", "source", "list"],
  "context": { "additional": "context" }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Investigation Start**: User submits a claim through MCP
2. **Task Creation**: Orchestrator creates tasks for all three agents
3. **Parallel Analysis**: 
   - Truth Seeker verifies primary sources
   - Trial by Fire waits for truth analysis, then argues both sides
   - Credibility Agent assesses sources independently
4. **Synthesis**: Final task combines all results
5. **Verdict**: Weighted scoring produces final conclusion with confidence level

## Integration Points

- Uses existing LLM provider system
- Follows established task management patterns
- Compatible with WebSocket monitoring
- Integrates with quality gateway system
- Works within Fortune 500 agent framework

## Usage Example

```bash
# Start the MCP server with truth-finding support
npm run start:v2

# In your MCP client, use the truth_investigate tool:
{
  "tool": "truth_investigate",
  "arguments": {
    "claim": "Climate change is primarily caused by human activities",
    "type": "scientific",
    "sources": ["IPCC Report 2023", "NASA Climate Data"]
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements Possible

1. Real-time web scraping for source verification
2. Integration with fact-checking APIs
3. Support for multimedia evidence
4. Blockchain-based evidence authentication
5. Multi-language support
6. Historical claim tracking database

The system is fully integrated and ready to use. It follows all the patterns established in the Debo codebase and provides a robust, legally-grounded approach to truth verification.
