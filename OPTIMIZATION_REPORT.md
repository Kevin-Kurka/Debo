- **Impact**: Predictable memory usage, automatic data compression
- **File**: `src/services/memory-manager.js`

### 5. **Orchestration Unification** ✅
- **Before**: 4 separate orchestrators with circular dependencies
- **After**: 1 adaptive orchestrator with strategy pattern
- **Impact**: Eliminated circular dependencies, cleaner architecture
- **File**: `src/services/unified-orchestrator-service.js`

### 6. **Shared Utilities Library** ✅
- **Before**: 40+ duplicated code patterns across the codebase
- **After**: Consolidated utility library with standardized operations
- **Impact**: 50% reduction in duplicate code, easier maintenance
- **File**: `src/utils/shared-utilities.js`
